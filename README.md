Develop a tool to detect and extract tables from system-generated PDFs.The extracted tables should then be stored in an Excel sheet.

In this project, I developed a Python-based tool to extract and analyze transaction data from bank statement PDFs. I used libraries like pdfplumber to read tables directly from the PDF and converted them into a structured DataFrame using pandas. After extracting the raw data, I cleaned it by removing unwanted characters and converting text-based numeric fields (like Balance and Amount) into proper float types. Once the data was cleaned, I performed some basic analysisâ€”such as calculating total credits, debits, average transaction values, and listing unique transaction types. I also exported the cleaned dataset to an Excel file for record-keeping and generated a summary report with the key insights. This tool is helpful for automating personal finance tracking and can easily be adapted for more advanced financial analysis or dashboarding.
